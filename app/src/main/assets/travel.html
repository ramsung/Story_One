<h3><span style="color: #339966;">1. Have a clear storyline</span></h3>
<p>A trip is not a story in itself, it&rsquo;s just a series of events. Some of these events will be interesting (you made it up Kilimanjaro!) and some will not (you arrived back at the airport on time*). As a writer, your first job is to decide on the particular story you want to tell, and the events which make up that story.&nbsp;<br /><br />To see the kinds of stories that get published, look at the bold line of introductory copy (known as &lsquo;standfirsts&rsquo; in the trade) of articles in papers, magazines and websites. Try writing the standfirst for your own story, and then use it as your brief.</p>
<p><em>*Actually, that might be interesting, but only if your story was about how everything ran late in Tanzania.<br /><br /></em></p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">2. Have a goal</span></h3>
<p>Some trips have a physical objective (reaching the top of Kilimanjaro, crossing Costa Rica, seeing a tiger) that gives your article direction and purpose. The reader (hopefully) sticks with you because they want to know if you&rsquo;ll achieve your goal.&nbsp;<br /><br />But many trips don&rsquo;t have an obvious goal; they are more about discovering a place, unpicking its history or meeting its people. In this case, create a personal goal to give your reader a sense of where you&rsquo;re taking them. Sentences like &ldquo;I wanted to discover&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;I was keen to understand&hellip;&rdquo; give readers an idea of what&rsquo;s to come, instead of you simply plunging them into the unknown.<br /><br /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">3. Edit your experience to fit your story</span></h3>
<p>Stories have characters, dialogue, pace, plot, suspense, drama &ndash; they need shaping and organising to hold the reader's attention. Once you know your storyline, gather the experiences that fit it &ndash; and dump the rest. Most travel articles will be 1,000 to 2,000 words: that&rsquo;s only 10-20 paragraphs. You don&rsquo;t have time for detours.<em><br /></em><br /><br /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">4. Write an irresistible first paragraph</span></h3>
<p>You can start a travel article any way you like, as long as it grabs the reader&rsquo;s attention. You can use drama, humour, dialogue, (or all three) &ndash; but those first sentences must grip like glue. Most travel articles start&nbsp;<em>in media res</em>&nbsp;&ndash; in the thick of the story &ndash; and then backtrack to explain how you happened to be in this situation.<br /><br /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">5. Include dialogue</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Look! There! The lions are on the prowl,&rdquo; whispered Joseph. Or: we could see the lions heading off hunting. Which sentence is more interesting to read? Dialogue brings a scene to life, gives personality to the people in your story, and allows you to convey important information in a punchy way. Whenever you travel, make notes of what people say and how they say it.<br /><br /><br /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">6. Show and tell</span></h3>
<p>&lsquo;Showing&rsquo; and &lsquo;telling&rsquo; are two everyday storytelling techniques you probably use without realising. Showing is when you slow down your writing and describe a scene in detail &ndash; what you saw, tasted, heard, felt: you are showing the reader the world through your eyes. Telling is simply moving the story along: &lsquo;We returned to the tents for a well-earned rest&rsquo;.&nbsp;<br /><br />Articles typically switch repeatedly between the drama of &lsquo;showing&rsquo; and the practical economy of &lsquo;telling&rsquo;: you need both.<br /><br /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">7. Aim to entertain, not impress</span></h3>
<p>Novice writers often try to pack their writing with literary phrases or recherch&eacute; nomenclature (like that). Good writers tend more to follow Hemingway&rsquo;s maxim: &ldquo;My aim is to put down on paper what I see and what I feel in the best and simplest way.&rdquo; That doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t be playful and experimental: just don&rsquo;t do it at the reader&rsquo;s expense.<br /><br /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">8. Use vivid language</span></h3>
<p>Travel articles are peppered with meaningless words and phrases: stunning, incredible, pretty, diverse; &lsquo;land of contrasts&rsquo;, &lsquo;melting pot&rsquo;, &lsquo;bustling&rsquo;. Any of these could be applied to thousands of destinations worldwide. Try to use language that is specific to what you&rsquo;re describing, and which allows readers to paint a picture in their mind&rsquo;s eye.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>9. <span style="color: #339966;">Leave signposts</span></h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wandering around a strange country without a guidebook, you look for signposts. So do readers as they travel through your story. Every few paragraphs tell them where you&rsquo;re going next, and remind them of your ultimate goal.&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, you could write: &lsquo;The next day we travelled from Tokyo to Hirosaki.&rsquo; Or you could signpost things a little, by writing: &lsquo;It was tempting to linger in Tokyo&rsquo;s restaurants, but my search for Japan&rsquo;s best sake would next take me deep into the countryside.&rsquo; Aha, thinks the reader: I can see where this is going, and why &ndash; I&rsquo;ll keep tagging along.<br /><br /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">10. Give yourself time to finish</span></h3>
<p>In an effort to include every fascinating tidbit, too may travel articles finish like a high-speed train hitting the buffers, leaving readers dazed and confused. With a paragraph to spare, put the brakes on and start setting up your conclusion.&nbsp;<br /><br />Show your readers that the end is nigh. Think about where you started, and reflect on the journey. Try to sum up the experience. And &ndash; please &ndash; come up with something more inspiring than &lsquo;I would just have to come back another time.&rsquo;</p>
