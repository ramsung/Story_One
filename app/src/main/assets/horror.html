<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>1. Try to be original</strong></span></p>
<p>The more different you make your story, the more it will appeal to publishers and readers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>2. Plan your story in advance&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>There is nothing worse than coming to a dead end halfway through your story due to a sudden writer's block.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Create strong, identifiable characters&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Give them a goal and throw obstacle after obstacle at them. If you don't care about your characters, your readers certainly won't, and will discard your story with a weary yawn! There is nothing worse than shallow, cardboard characters in a story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>4. Read the masters of horror fiction to gain a good, broad idea of what works and what doesn't&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>There are many outstanding horror writers you can study, artists who have mastered the craft, especially Stephen King, James Herbert and H.P. Lovecraft.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>5. Study the classic horror novels&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Bram Stoker's DRACULA and Mary Shelly's FRANKENSTEIN are perfect examples of how good horror novels should be constructed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>6. Do your research thoroughly&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>If you are writing a vampire story, read EVERYTHING about them. If you are writing a ghost story, familiarize yourself with the work of paranormal investigators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>7. Do not rush your work as the urge to get published gets stronger&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Remember, if your story is sloppy and rushed, your readers will soon notice it! So, take your time to perfect everything before you submit your manuscript, from getting your character profiles right to creating the BEST ending you possible can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>8. Read, read, read EVERYTHING you can&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Not just horror, but other books you like as well. The more you read, the more you will get a good feel and knowledge of how novels and short stories are put together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008080;">9. Try to pick a subject that scares you personally</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If, say, spiders are your number one fear, then get all your emotions down on paper about them. Remember: the more emotional power you pack into your prose, the more the readers will become terrified with you. They will FEEL your horror as they absorb each terrifying word, and become scared to death with you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>10. Finally, make sure your masterpiece has no spelling mistakes or other grammatical failings which may dissuade a publisher or agent from taking your work on&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>You MUST make your story or novel as neatly and professionally presented as possible.</p>
