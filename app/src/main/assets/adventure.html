<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Adventure is an exciting, thrill-filled genre that emphasizes suspenseful, fast-paced action. In a typical adventure story, a hero embarks on a journey filled with dangerous obstacles and villains that render his survival uncertain. Planning the crucial elements of an adventure story -- a journey to an exotic location, plot twists, an exciting climax and a resolution that rewards the hero and punishes the bad guy -- will help you create a riveting tale.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Choose a faraway, exotic location for your hero to visit. Foreign countries, deserted islands or even other worlds altogether are obvious choices, but heroes don&rsquo;t necessarily have to leave their backyards to find an adventure. In a children&rsquo;s story, the heroine could find adventure in a forest near her house.</strong></span></p>

<p class="highlighted"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Create a hero or heroine. Adventure stories typically do not focus on character development, but your protagonist should possess some kind of defined role, whether he holds a job or is a student. Allot your character some distinctive physical features, as well as a curiosity for exploring. Alternatively, you could create a reluctant hero, in the style of Bilbo Baggins from &ldquo;The Hobbit.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="section-4" class="section" style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Invent a catalyst for your adventure story. Give your protagonist a reason to leave and go exploring. This catalyst should involve some danger, to build suspense. For example, in &ldquo;Indiana Jones,&rdquo; a professor is led to search for an artifact he believes could be lethal if it falls into the wrong hands.</strong></span></p>

<div id="section-5" class="section" style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Craft some unexpected twists and turns to challenge your protagonist. She could get lost following a false clue, become kidnapped by a villain, find a treasure map or have an ally betray her or die.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div id="section-6" class="section" style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Construct a spellbinding climax wherein the hero faces extreme danger and a positive outcome of events seems doubtful. Include a tell-all confrontation between the protagonist and antagonist, where the hero finally learns the villain&rsquo;s motives.</strong></span></p>

<div id="section-7" class="section">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Resolve the climax with the defeat of the antagonist by the protagonist and her friends. Allow the protagonist to return home with the promise of resuming normal life.</strong></span></p>
